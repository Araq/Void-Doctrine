# •Sum•
__Void°Doctrine__ is a low-profile userdata observer, made to detect and log visible [vKontakte](https://vk.com) page changes on demand.  
Developed to be as inconspicuous as possible, it's packed in single executable with no requirements beyond service [API token](https://vk.com/dev/access_token).

# •Featuræ•
* No installation, placing _Void°Doctrine.exe_ to some writeable dir is enough.
* No account credentials required to work (stock token included).
* No external dependencies beyond VC runtime.
